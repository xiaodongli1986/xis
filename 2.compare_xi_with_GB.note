I checked the measured value of 2pCF at s=50:
	Our 2pCF gives s^2*xi(s) = 
		~60 (0.15-0.27)
		~80 (0.27-0.35)  
		~95 (0.35-0.43) 
		~60 for CMASS bins
	I checked GBZ result, they give
		~70 (0.2-0.35)
		~85 (0.24-0.39)
		~80 (0.28-0.43)
		~60 for high redshift CMASS bins
		
Roughly they are OK; Our 3rd-bin value a little large;
